Problem Section
Headline:
That Quote Is Too High. Here's Why.
Body:
Most of the big HVAC companies in Arizona aren't local anymore. They got bought out by private equity firms who answer to investors, not homeowners.
That means:

40%+ markups on equipment
"Premium" charges for standard installations
Commissioned salespeople pushing upgrades you don't need
Hidden fees that show up on install day

You're not paying for a better AC. You're paying for their profit margins.

Solution Section
Headline:
We Beat Their Prices. Every Time.
Body:
We're a family-owned shop with no investors, no bloated overhead, and no sales guys working on commission.
We install the same Trane equipment as the big guys. Same warranties. Same quality. We just don't charge you 40% extra to cover someone's private equity returns.
